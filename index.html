					speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us: <br></br>

					Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of
					knowledge...and that is priceless.</p1>

		<ul>
			<li> Package: $95 </li>
			<li> Patron Package: $200 </li>
